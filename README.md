# WasteClassify
A computer vision-based deep learning tool to assist residents in classifying solid wastes for proper disposal. There are artificial intelligence models for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Used PyTorch and Tensorflow Lite to integrate models into a mobile application published on the Google Play store.

Research conducted through Computer Science and Informatics Summer Research Experience Program(CSIRE) @ Stony Brook University
